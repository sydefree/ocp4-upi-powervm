# Introduction
The `ocp4-upi-powervm` [project](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-upi-powervm) provides Terraform based automation code to help the deployment of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x on PowerVM systems managed by PowerVC.

If you are using standalone PowerVM please take a look at the [following quickstart guide](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/ocp4-helpernode/blob/devel/docs/quickstart-powervm.md)
which uses the [ansible playbook](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/ocp4-helpernode) to setup a helper node (bastion) for OCP deployment.

This project also leverages the same ansible playbook internally for OCP deployment on PowerVM LPARs managed via PowerVC.
